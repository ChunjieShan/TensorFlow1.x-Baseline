# TensorFlow 1.x baseline
This is my TensorFlow 1.x baseline.  
I do like TensorFlow 1.x more than 2.x, because I don't want to make Keras everywhere xD.

## Contents
1. net.py: It contains my network structure built by tf.layers.
2. dataset.py: It contains how to load the dataset and how to feed data to the model.
3. train.py: The training scripts.
